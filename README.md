# DevOps-Project-list
That's a great plan, Aditya! Starting from **basic** projects and gradually moving towards **intermediate** and then **advanced** DevOps projects is the right way to build logic, real-world understanding, and career-ready skills.

Below is a **carefully curated list** of projects divided into **three levels** — all **aligned with real-world use cases** and reflecting what companies actually do in production.

## 🧠 How to Approach These Projects

1. **Pick 1 project per level and build in-depth**
2. **Use GitHub to maintain version control and track progress**
3. **Document everything**: write READMEs, architecture diagrams, and CI/CD pipeline flows
4. **Create a portfolio website** (can use React + Tailwind CSS) to showcase all your DevOps projects
5. **Move from local setup to cloud deployment** (AWS/GCP/Azure)

Excellent, Aditya! Once you’ve mastered those DevOps projects, moving into **DevSecOps** (Development + Security + Operations) will place you in a highly **in-demand** and **future-proof** role — especially for enterprises and cloud-native applications where security **must be automated** and **built into the pipeline**.
